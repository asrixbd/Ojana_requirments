## ü§ù A Note on Exceptions (The Second Chance)

We believe in potential and passion!

**If you fail to meet the requirements‚Äîfor instance, if your YouTube channel is new or your activity isn't quite at the suggested level‚Äîdon't worry! We may still give you a chance to join.**

If your application shows incredible passion, maturity, and a genuine desire to create content with us, we are always willing to make exceptions. We are building a community, not just checking boxes.
